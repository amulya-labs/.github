# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a vulnerability in any Amulya Labs project, please report it using [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) feature (GHSA).

**Do not** open a public issue or send emails for security vulnerabilities.

### Coordinated Disclosure

We commit to:
- **Acknowledgment**: Within 5 business days
- **Timeline**: 90-day coordinated disclosure window before public acknowledgment
- **Communication**: GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) only—no email addresses

This approach protects users while giving us time to develop and release patches responsibly.
